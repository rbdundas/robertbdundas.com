                        This site is the proverbial dumping ground for everything that I have collected along the way. It
                        is to act as both a repository for the lessons learned, as well as a resume for the skills that I
                        have collected. I intend to publish a book on Insuretech and this will serve as a respository for
                        articles on that topic as well.

                    <p class="content">
                        This site was built using Laravel (PHP 7.4) and MySQL for the back-end. The
                        front-end is primarily Vue.js integrated with the Laravel Blade templates, and some of the components
                        use Buefy (a Vue.js component library). The entire site is styled with Bulma CSS, a very easy to
                        use CSS library. The appearance of 'hodge-podge' is intentional to provide examples of each of the
                        features and/or components. Where possible, features in this site/application will have a corresponding
                        how-to article for it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        I chose the Laravel/MySQL/Vue combination because I was comfortable with it to get something up and running fast,
                        and I knew that my hosting provider could support my application very easily. It is a
                        very simple, reliable, and extendable framework that uses the MVC model of which I am very accustomed. That said,
                        I am hoping to build the site out to give more features and it won't be a single stack but a composite of many
                        different technologies. I happen to like this stack because it can be supported by a very large development community, and even though I
                        may be showcasing other technologies on this site, the core application is using what I consider to be
                        a very robust standard in the industry.
